# Calculator

This project is a calculator I originally built in codepen. The original code was pretty bad and had a few bugs, so I decided to redo it.

The new version is built with Vue and Vuex and can be viewed on [codepen here.](https://codepen.io/anthonykoch/pen/xVQOwb)

## Serve

To serve the site, run the following command. It will start a gulp process which process sass, pug, and other files as they change.

```
npm run serve
```

The new calculator is at `localhost:4000` old calculator is at `localhost:4000/calc.html`.
